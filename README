Once setup, you can add the Google AdSense ad to your views by using the helper method google_ad.
That is, something like this:

<%= google_ad %>

To use more than one google ad on the same page, you can give a unique identifier when setting up
the ad by using the :id option. For example, when can set up two different looking ads and display
them on the same page by:

		uses_google_ad_sense(:id => :horizontal_ad,
												 :ad_client => "pub-5044505066435851",
		                     :format    => :leader_board,
		                     :type      => :ad)
		
		uses_google_ad_sense(:id => :vertical_ad,
												 :ad_client => "pub-5044505066435851",
		                     :format    => :vertical_banner,
		                     :type      => :ad)
		
Then to display them in your view, you would use:

<%= google_ad(:horizontal_ad) %>
<%= google_ad(:vertical_ad) %>
