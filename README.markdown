GoogleAdSense
=============

When you install the plugin you will end up with a google_ad_sense.yml file in
your config directory.  You can change all the parameters here.

Available options are,

	**ad_client**
		*The special identifier given to you by google, you can find this under "My Account" in your Google AdSense login. (required)*
	**format**
		*How the ad will be displayed. The different formats are listed in `formats` (required)*
	**type**
		*Whether the ad shown is a "Ad Unit" or a "Link Unit". Specificied with `ad` or `link` respectively. (required)*
	**image**
		*Whether to use images for this ad. (optional)*
	**text**
		*Whether to use text for this ad. (optional)*
	**colors**
		*The different colors you can use to customer the ad. (optional)*
	**width**
		*The width of the ad. (optional)*
	**height**
		*The height of the ad. (optional)*
	**ads_per_unit**
		*The number of ads per unit, only used by a "Link Unit" ad.*
	**formats**
		*The formats that I've coded in, you can add more if you want.*

The different formats available include:

    leader_board, banner, half_banner, skyscraper, wide_skyscraper,
    vertical_banner, large_rectangle, medium_rectangle,
    square, small_square, small_rectangle, button

And colors you can customise include:

    border, bg, link, text, url

Note: these colors need to be given as a hex value.

Once setup, you can add the Google AdSense ad to your views by using the helper method google_ad.
That is, something like this:

    <%= google_ad %>

This will add in the default format, ie. the one that is set in the `format` setting in the YAML file.

    <%= google_ad(:banner) %>

This will use the `banner` format settings from your `formats` array in the YAML file.
